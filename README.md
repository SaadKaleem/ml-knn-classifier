# Machine Learning - KNN Classifier & Noise Reduction Techniques.

Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor ML Algorithm &amp; Noise Reduction (Tomek Links Technique) on a set of synthetic generated random data on the 2D plane.

The libraries NumPy and Matplotlib were utilized for array-processing and generating graphs respectively.

A detailed analysis can be found [here](../master/ML_KNN_Report_Analysis.pdf).
